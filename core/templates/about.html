                    <p>
                        Hi, I am <strong>Ishan Tiwari</strong>, a BCA II Year student at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial
                        College of
                        Management, Lucknow.
                        I am passionate about technology, especially web development and Python programming.
                        JobSet is my first hands-on project where I tried to build a useful job portal from scratch
                        using
                        basic web development skills.
                        I'm still learning and exploring new things in the field of software and tech.

                        <h1>What is JobSet?</h1>
                        <p>
                            JobSet is a job and internship portal designed especially for students and freshers. It
                            helps users
                            register, create a profile, and explore job listings with ease.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why This Project Was Built</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project was developed as part of my BCA curriculum to showcase my understanding of web
                            development using HTML, CSS, and Python (Django).
                            The aim was to create a practical and user-friendly job portal specifically for students and
                            freshers. <br>
                            Through JobSet, I wanted to demonstrate how real-world applications like user login, profile
                            handling, and job searching can be built with simple technologies.
